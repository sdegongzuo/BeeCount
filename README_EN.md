## ☁️ Cloud Backup Configuration (Optional)

### Why Choose Self-Hosted Cloud Service?

- **Data Sovereignty**: Data completely stored in servers or cloud platforms you control
- **Privacy Protection**: Developers cannot access any of your data
- **Cost Control**: Most solutions offer free tiers or one-time purchase options
- **Stable & Reliable**: No dependency on third-party hosting services, full control
- **Flexible Choice**: Choose the most suitable solution based on your needs

### Option 1: Custom Supabase (Recommended for Beginners)

**Use Case**: Suitable for users without NAS devices who want to get started quickly

**Configuration Steps**:

1. **Create Supabase Project**
   - Visit [supabase.com](https://supabase.com) to register an account
   - Create a new project, select appropriate region
   - Get URL and anon key from project settings

2. **Configure Storage**
   - Create a Storage Bucket named `beecount-backups` in Supabase console
   - Set as Private (uncheck Public bucket)
   - **Configure RLS Access Policies**: Create 4 policies to ensure users can only access their own data
     - Go to the bucket's Policies tab
     - Create the following 4 policies (each with the same configuration):
       - **SELECT**: Allow users to read their own backup files
       - **INSERT**: Allow users to create new backup files
       - **UPDATE**: Allow users to update their own backup files
       - **DELETE**: Allow users to delete their own backup files
     - Configuration for each policy:
       - **Policy name**: Customizable (e.g., `Allow user access to own backups`)
       - **Target roles**: Select `authenticated`
       - **Policy definition**: Enter the following expression
         ```sql
         ((bucket_id = 'beecount-backups'::text) AND ((storage.foldername(name))[1] = 'users'::text) AND ((storage.foldername(name))[2] = (auth.uid())::text))
         ```
       - This policy ensures users can only access files under `beecount-backups/users/<their-user-id>/` path

3. **App Configuration**
   - Open BeeCount → Profile → Cloud Service
   - Tap "Add Custom Cloud Service"
   - Select service type: **Supabase**
   - Enter your Supabase URL and anon key
   - Save and enable configuration
   - Tap "Login", register/sign in and start syncing

### Option 2: WebDAV Server (Recommended for NAS Users)

**Use Case**: For users with NAS devices or private cloud storage

**Supported Services**:
- ✅ UGREEN Cloud NAS
- ✅ Synology NAS
- ✅ Nextcloud
- ✅ Nutstore WebDAV
- ✅ ownCloud
- ✅ Any server supporting WebDAV protocol

**Configuration Steps**:

1. **Enable WebDAV Service**
   - Enable WebDAV functionality on your NAS or cloud storage platform
   - Note the WebDAV server address (e.g., `http://nas.local:5005`)
   - Create or use existing user account

2. **Prepare Storage Directory** (Optional)
   - Create a `BeeCount` folder in WebDAV root directory
   - Or use any path (specify during configuration)

3. **App Configuration**
   - Open BeeCount → Profile → Cloud Service
   - Tap "Add Custom Cloud Service"
   - Select service type: **WebDAV**
   - Fill in configuration:
     - **WebDAV Server URL**: e.g., `http://nas.local:5005`
     - **Username**: Your WebDAV username
     - **Password**: Your WebDAV password
     - **Remote Path**: Storage path (e.g., `/home/BeeCount` or `/BeeCount`)
   - Tap "Test Connection" to verify configuration
   - Save and enable configuration
   - WebDAV requires no additional login, can sync directly after configuration

**Common WebDAV Configuration Examples**:

```
UGREEN Cloud NAS:
- URL: http://your-nas-address:5005
- Remote Path: /home/BeeCount

Synology NAS:
- URL: http://your-nas-address:5005 or https://your-domain

## 💬 FAQ

**Q: Can I use it normally without configuring cloud services?**
A: Absolutely! The app uses local storage by default, and all features work normally. You can still export CSV backups at any time.

**Q: Should I choose Supabase or WebDAV?**
A:
- If you have a NAS device or private cloud, we recommend WebDAV (fully localized data)
- If you don't have a NAS, we recommend Supabase (free, stable, easy to configure)
- Both support complete sync functionality, choose based on your needs

**Q: Why can't I upload after configuring WebDAV?**
A:
- Check if WebDAV service is enabled and port is correct
- Verify username and password are correct
- Some NAS WebDAV requires specific paths for write access (e.g., UGREEN Cloud requires `/home/` path)
- Click "Test Connection" button to view detailed error messages

**Q: Can I switch back to default mode after configuring custom cloud service?**
A: Yes, you can switch anytime. The saved custom configuration won't be lost and can be re-enabled.

**Q: How to ensure data security?**
A:
- Use your own Supabase project or WebDAV server
- Regularly export CSV backups to local storage
- Use strong passwords and enable two-factor authentication (if supported)
- For WebDAV, recommend using HTTPS for encrypted transmission

**Q: What data formats are supported?**
A: Currently supports CSV format for import/export, compatible with data formats from most mainstream accounting apps.

**Q: How to sync data across multiple devices?**
A:
- **Supabase**: Configure same URL and anon key on all devices, log in with same account
- **WebDAV**: Configure same WebDAV server address and credentials on all devices
